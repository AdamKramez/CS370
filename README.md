1. Work Completed on This Project

I was given starter code for the maze environment (TreasureMaze.py) and experience replay (GameExperience.py). My task was to implement deep Q-learning in qtrain(), focusing on action selection, reward shaping, and training optimization. Despite multiple adjustments, the agent failed to reach the treasure.

2. Connection to the Field of Computer Science

Role of Computer Scientists

Computer scientists develop algorithms and AI models to solve complex problems, impacting fields like automation and data science. This project simulated AI research in reinforcement learning.

Problem-Solving Approach

Problem-solving involves breaking issues into components, testing solutions, and refining based on results. I iteratively adjusted learning strategies to improve agent performance.

Ethical Responsibilities

Ethical considerations in AI include fairness, efficiency, and transparency. In this project, I ensured responsible resource use and unbiased decision-making in reinforcement learning.
